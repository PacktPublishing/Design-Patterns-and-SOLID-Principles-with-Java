# Design Patterns and SOLID Principles with Java [Video]
This is the code repository for [Design Patterns and SOLID Principles with Java [Video]]( https://www.packtpub.com/programming/design-patterns-and-solid-principles-with-java-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This course will guide you through the whys and hows of important design patterns using SOLID principles and, more importantly, will help you recognize opportunities to apply these; its focus is on real-world problems and down-to-earth explanations to get you started quickly. The goal of the course is not to have you breeze through every design pattern in existence in a few minutes with oversimplified examples. Instead, you will learn selected design patterns in an in-depth way. During the course, you'll also familiarize yourself with the major aspects of SOLID design and writing clean code, as these concepts and applying design patterns should go hand-in-hand.
By the end of the course, you will be able to identify (and confidently apply) design patterns in your own applications and be empowered to make your design choices using complex examples.
